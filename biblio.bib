New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

Additionally, it enables a new stress divergence discretization that effortlessly allows all MPM simulations to run two times faster than before. We also develop a Compatible Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) algorithm on top of MLS-MPM. Utilizing a colored distance field representation and a novel compatibility condition for particles and grid nodes, our framework enables the simulation of various new phenomena that are not previously supported by MPM, including material cutting, dynamic open boundaries, and two-way coupling with rigid bodies. MLS-MPM with CPIC is easy to implement and friendly to performance optimization.},

  abstract = {Recently the Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) Method was proposed by Jiang et al.[2015; 2017b] to improve the accuracy of the transfers in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) [Harlow 1964] techniques by augmenting each particle with a locally affine, rather than locally constant description of the velocity. This reduced the dissipation of the original PIC without suffering from the noise present in the historic alternative, Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) [Brackbill and Ruppel 1986]. We present a generalization of APIC by augmenting each particle with a more general local function. By viewing the grid-to-particle transfer as a linear and angular momentum conserving projection of the particle-wise local grid velocities onto a reduced basis, we greatly improve the energy and vorticity conservation over the original APIC. Furthermore, we show that the cost of the generalized projection is negligible over APIC when using a particular class of local polynomial functions. Lastly, we note that our method retains the filtering property of APIC and PIC and thus has similar robustness to noise.},

  abstract = {The Material Point Method (MPM) discrete solution procedure for computational solid mechanics is generalized using a variational form and a Petrov- Galerkin discretization scheme, resulting in a family of methods named the Generalized Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) methods. The generalization permits iden- tification with aspects of other point or node based dis- crete solution techniques which do not use a body-fixed grid, i.e. the "meshless methods". Similarities are noted and some practical advantages relative to some of these methods are identified. Examples are used to demon- strate and explain numerical artifact noise which can be expected in MPM calculations. This noise results in non- physical local variations at the material points, where constitutive response is evaluated. It is shown to destroy the explicit solution in one case, and seriously degrade it in another. History dependent, inelastic constitutive laws can be expected to evolve erroneously and report inac- curate stress states because of noisy input. The noise is due to the lack of smoothness of the interpolation func- tions, and occurs due to material points crossing compu- tational grid boundaries. The next degree of smoothness available in the GIMP methods is shown to be capable of eliminating cell crossing noise. keyword: MPM, PIC, meshless methods, Petrov- Galerkin discretization.},

  abstract = {Forecasting of a physical system is computed by the help of a mathematical model. This model needs to be initialized by the state of the system at initial time. But this state is not directly measurable and data assimilation techniques are generally used to estimate it. They combine all sources of information such as observations (that may be sparse in time and space and potentially include errors), previous forecasts, the model equations and error statistics. The main idea of data assimilation techniques is to ﬁnd an initial state accounting for the diﬀerent sources of informations. Such techniques are widely used in meteorology, where data and particularly images are more and more numerous due to the increasing number of satellites and other sources of measurements. This, coupled with developments of meteorological models, have led to an ever-increasing quality of the forecast.},

  abstract   = {A suboptimal Kalman filter called the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ET KF) is introduced. Like other Kalman filters, it provides a framework for assimilating observations and also for estimating the effect of observations on forecast error covariance. It differs from other ensemble Kalman filters in that it uses ensemble transformation and a normalization to rapidly obtain the prediction error covariance matrix associated with a particular deployment of observational resources. This rapidity enables it to quickly assess the ability of a large number of future feasible sequences of observational networks to reduce forecast error variance. The ET KF was used by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction in the Winter Storm Reconnaissance missions of 1999 and 2000 to determine where aircraft should deploy dropwindsondes in order to improve 24-72-h forecasts over the continental United States. The ET KF may be applied to any well-constructed set of ensemble perturbations. The ET KF technique supercedes the ensemble transform (ET) targeting technique of Bishop and Toth. In the ET targeting formulation, the means by which observations reduced forecast error variance was not expressed mathematically. The mathematical representation of this process provided by the ET KF enables such things as the evaluation of the reduction in forecast error variance associated with individual flight tracks and assessments of the value of targeted observations that are distributed over significant time intervals. It also enables a serial targeting methodology whereby one can identify optimal observing sites given the location and error statistics of other observations. This allows the network designer to nonredundantly position targeted observations. Serial targeting can also be used to greatly reduce the computations required to identify optimal target sites. For these theoretical and practical reasons, the ET KF technique is more useful than the ET technique. The methodology is illustrated with observation system simulation experiments involving a barotropic numerical model of tropical cyclonelike vortices. These include preliminary empirical tests of ET KF predictions using ET KF. 3DVAR. and hybrid data assimilation schemes-the results of which look promising. To concisely describe the future feasible sequences of observations considered in adaptive sampling problems, an extension to Ide et al.'s unified notation for data assimilation is suggested.},

  abstract  = {Ensemble Kalman Filters are used extensively in all geoscience areas. Often a stochastic variant is used, in which each ensemble member is updated via the Kalman Filter equation with an extra perturbation in the innovation. These perturbations are essential for the correct ensemble spread in a stochastic Ensemble Kalman Filter, and are applied either to the observations or to the modelled observations. This paper investigates if there is a preference for either of these two perturbation methods. Both versions lead to the same posterior mean and covariance when the prior and the likelihood are Gaussian in the state. However, ensemble verification methods, Bayes' Theorem and the Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (BLUE) suggest that one should perturb the modelled observations. Furthermore, it is known that in non-Gaussian settings the perturbed modelled observation scheme is preferred, illustrated here for a skewed likelihood. Existing reasons for the perturbed observation scheme are shown to be incorrect, and no new arguments in favour of that scheme have been found. Finally, a new and consistent derivation and interpretation of the stochastic version of the EnKF equations is derived based on perturbing modelled observations. It is argued that these results have direct consequences for (iterative) Ensemble Kalman Filters and Smoothers, including “perturbed observation” 3D- and 4D-Vars, both in terms of internal consistency and implementation.},

The method combines concepts from optimal transportation theory with material-point sampling and max-ent meshfree interpolation. The proposed OTM method generalizes the Benamou–Brenier differential formulation of optimal mass transportation problems to problems including arbitrary geometries and constitutive behavior. The OTM method enforces mass transport and essential boundary conditions exactly and is free from tension instabilities. The OTM method exactly conserves linear and angular momentum and its convergence characteristics are verified in standard benchmark problems. We illustrate the range and scope of the method by means of two examples of application: the bouncing of a gas-filled balloon off a rigid wall; and the classical Taylor-anvil benchmark test extended to the hypervelocity range.
