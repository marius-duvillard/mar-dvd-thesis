MLS-MPM naturally leads to the formulation of Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) [Jiang et al. 2015] and Polynomial Particle-In-Cell [Fu et al. 2017] in a way that is consistent with a Galerkin-style weak form discretization of the governing equations. Additionally, it enables a new stress divergence discretization that effortlessly allows all MPM simulations to run two times faster than before. We also develop a Compatible Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) algorithm on top of MLS-MPM. Utilizing a colored distance field representation and a novel compatibility condition for particles and grid nodes, our framework enables the simulation of various new phenomena that are not previously supported by MPM, including material cutting, dynamic open boundaries, and two-way coupling with rigid bodies. MLS-MPM with CPIC is easy to implement and friendly to performance optimization.},

  abstract = {Recently the Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) Method was proposed by Jiang et al.[2015; 2017b] to improve the accuracy of the transfers in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) [Harlow 1964] techniques by augmenting each particle with a locally affine, rather than locally constant description of the velocity. This reduced the dissipation of the original PIC without suffering from the noise present in the historic alternative, Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) [Brackbill and Ruppel 1986]. We present a generalization of APIC by augmenting each particle with a more general local function. By viewing the grid-to-particle transfer as a linear and angular momentum conserving projection of the particle-wise local grid velocities onto a reduced basis, we greatly improve the energy and vorticity conservation over the original APIC. Furthermore, we show that the cost of the generalized projection is negligible over APIC when using a particular class of local polynomial functions. Lastly, we note that our method retains the filtering property of APIC and PIC and thus has similar robustness to noise.},

  abstract = {The Material Point Method (MPM) discrete solution procedure for computational solid mechanics is generalized using a variational form and a Petrov- Galerkin discretization scheme, resulting in a family of methods named the Generalized Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) methods. The generalization permits iden- tification with aspects of other point or node based dis- crete solution techniques which do not use a body-fixed grid, i.e. the "meshless methods". Similarities are noted and some practical advantages relative to some of these methods are identified. Examples are used to demon- strate and explain numerical artifact noise which can be expected in MPM calculations. This noise results in non- physical local variations at the material points, where constitutive response is evaluated. It is shown to destroy the explicit solution in one case, and seriously degrade it in another. History dependent, inelastic constitutive laws can be expected to evolve erroneously and report inac- curate stress states because of noisy input. The noise is due to the lack of smoothness of the interpolation func- tions, and occurs due to material points crossing compu- tational grid boundaries. The next degree of smoothness available in the GIMP methods is shown to be capable of eliminating cell crossing noise. keyword: MPM, PIC, meshless methods, Petrov- Galerkin discretization.},

  abstract = {Forecasting of a physical system is computed by the help of a mathematical model. This model needs to be initialized by the state of the system at initial time. But this state is not directly measurable and data assimilation techniques are generally used to estimate it. They combine all sources of information such as observations (that may be sparse in time and space and potentially include errors), previous forecasts, the model equations and error statistics. The main idea of data assimilation techniques is to ﬁnd an initial state accounting for the diﬀerent sources of informations. Such techniques are widely used in meteorology, where data and particularly images are more and more numerous due to the increasing number of satellites and other sources of measurements. This, coupled with developments of meteorological models, have led to an ever-increasing quality of the forecast.},

  abstract  = {Ensemble Kalman Filters are used extensively in all geoscience areas. Often a stochastic variant is used, in which each ensemble member is updated via the Kalman Filter equation with an extra perturbation in the innovation. These perturbations are essential for the correct ensemble spread in a stochastic Ensemble Kalman Filter, and are applied either to the observations or to the modelled observations. This paper investigates if there is a preference for either of these two perturbation methods. Both versions lead to the same posterior mean and covariance when the prior and the likelihood are Gaussian in the state. However, ensemble verification methods, Bayes' Theorem and the Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (BLUE) suggest that one should perturb the modelled observations. Furthermore, it is known that in non-Gaussian settings the perturbed modelled observation scheme is preferred, illustrated here for a skewed likelihood. Existing reasons for the perturbed observation scheme are shown to be incorrect, and no new arguments in favour of that scheme have been found. Finally, a new and consistent derivation and interpretation of the stochastic version of the EnKF equations is derived based on perturbing modelled observations. It is argued that these results have direct consequences for (iterative) Ensemble Kalman Filters and Smoothers, including “perturbed observation” 3D- and 4D-Vars, both in terms of internal consistency and implementation.},

The method combines concepts from optimal transportation theory with material-point sampling and max-ent meshfree interpolation. The proposed OTM method generalizes the Benamou–Brenier differential formulation of optimal mass transportation problems to problems including arbitrary geometries and constitutive behavior. The OTM method enforces mass transport and essential boundary conditions exactly and is free from tension instabilities. The OTM method exactly conserves linear and angular momentum and its convergence characteristics are verified in standard benchmark problems. We illustrate the range and scope of the method by means of two examples of application: the bouncing of a gas-filled balloon off a rigid wall; and the classical Taylor-anvil benchmark test extended to the hypervelocity range.

We ﬁrst discuss the existence of a dense ﬂow regime characterized by enduring contacts. We then emphasize that dimensional analysis strongly constrains the relation between stresses and shear rates, and show that results from experiments and simulations in different conﬁgurations support a description in terms of a frictional visco-plastic constitutive law. We then discuss the successes and limitations of this empirical rheology in light of recent alternative theoretical approaches. Finally, we brieﬂy present depth-averaged methods developed for free surface granular ﬂows.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations using a generalized interpolation material point method (GIMP) and material point method were introduced into the studying of granular mixing in a rotary drum. A Drucker–Prager model that has an equal size with a Mohr–Coulomb criterion was adopted to predict the failure behavior of granular matter. Experiments and discrete element method simulations were conducted to validate the models, and GIMP was finally used due to its accuracy and the ability for eliminating the crossing boundary noise. Velocity field of bed surface and standard deviation were used to measure the mixing performance. In particular, the influence of mesh size, elastic modulus, cohesion, and filling level were investigated. The results of simulations show that the utilization of GIMP significantly reduces the computing cost of simulation. The analysis of mixing performance shows that mixing performance decreases with the increase of elastic moduli, cohesion of granular matter, and filling levels.},

  abstract = {In many geomechanics applications, material boundaries are subjected to large displacements and deformation. Under these circumstances, the application of boundary conditions using particle methods, such as the material point method (MPM), becomes a challenging task since material boundaries do not coincide with the background mesh. This paper presents a formulation of penalty augmentation to impose nonhomogeneous, nonconforming Dirichlet boundary conditions in implicit MPM. The penalty augmentation is implemented utilizing boundary particles, which can move either according to or independently from the material deformation. Furthermore, releasing contact boundary condition, as well as the capability to accommodate slip boundaries, is introduced in the current work. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed in both 2D and 3D cases, by convergence analysis reaching the analytical solution and by comparing the results of nonconforming and classical grid-conforming simulations.},

The method is based on Hill’s formal theory of physical clusters. In the method, a molecular dynamics calculation is used to calculate the average potential energy of a cluster of molecules as a function of temperature, and the equilibrium constants are calculated from the integral of the energy with respect to reciprocal temperature. The method is illustrated by calculations of the equilibrium constants for the formation of clusters of two to five water molecules that interact with each other by an intermolecular potential devised by Watts. The method is compared with other procedures for calculating the thermodynamic properties of clusters.}},
